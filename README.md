## ABOUT THE PROJECT 
This was build to use in Rasberry pi 3 so it was mandatory for me to use lesser efficent model,
As well as had only around 200 image per classification.
there are both implementation of tensor flow and Tensor flow lite.
i have used two threads so that apperence would be presentable.
